# ORental

ORental is a peer-to-peer rental marketplace that allows people to rent out and discover under-used items such as cameras, gaming consoles, tools, and projectors from nearby users in a simple and trusted way.

The goal of ORental is to make local renting easy, affordable, and accessible while helping people make better use of items they already own.
